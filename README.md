## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install scapy
```

### Optional Features
For full functionality, install additional packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install individually:

## ‚≠ê Star History

If you find this tool useful, please consider giving it a star on GitHub!

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Network Security Analysis**: Identify potential threats and attacks
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Understand network usage patterns
- **Incident Response**: Analyze suspicious network activity
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Identify communication issues
- **Compliance Auditing**: Generate detailed network reports
- **Forensic Analysis**: Investigate network incidents

## üåç Geolocation API Configuration

### Important: HTTP vs HTTPS API Access

**Current Status**: The tool uses HTTPS for geolocation API calls for security.

**Free API Limitation**: The free ip-api.com service only supports HTTP, not HTTPS. This means:
- ‚úÖ **With HTTPS (Current)**: More secure but geolocation won't work with free API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **With HTTP**: Geolocation works but less secure data transmission

### Configuration Options

#### Option 1: Keep HTTPS (Recommended for Sensitive Data) üîí
```python
# Current setting in pcap_analyzer.py (line ~75)
response = requests.get(f"https://ip-api.com/json/{ip}", timeout=2)
```
- **Pros**: Secure encrypted API calls
- **Cons**: Geolocation feature won't work with free service

#### Option 2: Use HTTP for Working Geolocation üåç
```python
# Change line ~75 in pcap_analyzer.py to:
response = requests.get(f"http://ip-api.com/json/{ip}", timeout=2)
```
- **Pros**: Geolocation feature works with free API
- **Cons**: IP addresses sent unencrypted (minimal risk for most use cases)

#### Option 3: Use Alternative HTTPS Service
Consider using other geolocation APIs that support HTTPS in their free tier:
- ipinfo.io (limited free requests)
- ipgeolocation.io (with API key)

### Recommendation
For most users: **Use HTTP version** since IP addresses are not highly sensitive data, and you can always use `--no-geo` flag for sensitive analysis.

To modify: Edit line ~75 in `pcap_analyzer.py` and change `https://` to `http://`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Geolocation requests may take time for large numbers of public IPs
- Some features require internet connectivity (geolocation)
- Visualization requires matplotlib installation
- Large PCAP files may require significant processing time
- Analysis progress is displayed during processing
